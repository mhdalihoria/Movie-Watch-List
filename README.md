## Why this project?

- "Movie Watchlist" is a Solo project provided by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) to allow the students to challenge their knowledge to create unique web apps. 

- Solo projects are projects where you're only provided by a [Figma](https://www.figma.com) design and the student is left to make a pixel-perfect, fully functional web app.

- Learning how to communicate with an API and mutilating data was something new to me while creating this project and I wanted to challenge that knowledge to see if I can successfully finish this project.

## How to Use?

- Upon visiting the homepage the user has the option of typing in a movie name, or visit the watchlist page. 

- If the user chooses to type in a name. They will have the results of their search appear in a list. Each list has a "movie entry" that will display information about that specific movie, such as the poster, the title, rating and a button to add/remove movies to/from the watchlist, etc...

- Once a movie is added to the watchlist, it will similarly appear on the watchlist page compared to the home page. 

- And had the user choose to empty their watchlist, they can press on the "delete all" button, to clear their list and make room for more movies to watch!
